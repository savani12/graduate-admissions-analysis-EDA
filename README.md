# Graduate Admissions Analysis
The [Graduate Admission 2](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv) dataset available on Kaggle has been used in this project. 

The project aims at determining whether a student applying for a grad school has a chance at getting an admit based on his/her profile required by the school at the time of application. Also, students' profiles with a higher chance of admit are studied so as to analyse specific requirements for a higher chance of admit to an MS program. 

Detailed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is carried out on this dataset. Furthermore, predictions are made using several ML Algorithms.


Please refer to the notebook for a step-by-step execution of all the steps and related explanation.
